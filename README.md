* i is @joejo70 . . . i is joe
* i am a visual and physical creator with minimal coding know-how that has some-how been enough to put together an extensive folio site of my work using bootstrap www.joejo.com . . . some-how
* i am hoping to get some insight into emerging issues with my site from people with far greater know-how
* anyone able to offer insight would understand that i don't know even know how to talk about or refer to most of this
* i'm wandering into your world
